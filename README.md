# Cruzr-App

Cruzr-App is an android app that uses some of Cruzr's capabilities such as moving, rotating, speaking and more.

## How to install the app
If you are using Android Studio (this is recommended to build android apps), then it's pretty easy to install the app.
First you have to connect to Cruzr via adb, which can be done by either connecting a cable to it, or using the terminal to connect tot it via wifi.

Then go to android studio, open the project and then check which device is connected. If Cruzr is connected, then simply run the project and then wait for it to build and install the program.
